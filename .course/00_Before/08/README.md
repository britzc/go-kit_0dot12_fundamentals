# Implement the Endpoint Logic

In this exercise you are required to implement the MakeTotalWholesalePriceEndpoint, in order to interact with the Request / Response structures and interact with the service.

## You would be required to:
* Extend the existing PricingService interface to include the Wholesale function
* Create the endpoint to handle incoming Wholesale requests
* Read the TotalWholesalePriceRequest object from the request
* Call the PrivingService wholesale function with the request information received
* Respond with the TotalWholesalePriceResponse object in case of an error occurring
* Respond with the TotalWholesalePriceResponse object in case of no error occurring

## Important to pass the validation checks:
* Do not use parameter type sharing
* Use the naming conventions as per the code and examples
