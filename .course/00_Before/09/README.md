# Implement the Transport Logic

In this exercise you are required to implement the MakeTotalWholesalePriceHttpHandler and associated decode/encode functions, in order to communicate over the network.

## Your would be required to:
* Implement a decode function for the wholesale request object, to be used with the handler
* Ensure that the WholesalePriceRequest object is used in the decode function
* Implement a wholesale price HTTP handler, returning a httptransport.Server
* Return the server, ensuring that the wholesale decode and interface function is used

## Important to pass the validation checks:
* Do not use parameter type sharing
* Use the naming conventions as per the code and examples
