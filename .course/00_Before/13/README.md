# Instrumenting the Service

In this exercise you are required to instrument the service layer as part of the chain, capturing error and duration metrics for each interaction.

## You will be required to:
* Implement a instrumenting middleware endpoint to handle the wholesale service requests
* Use defer to capture the count and duration of the call
* Call the next item, using the service interface call

## Important to pass the validation checks:
* Do not use parameter type sharing
* Use the naming conventions as per the code and examples
