# Implement the New Calculation

In this exercise you are required to implement the GetWholesaleTotal calculation, which applies a discount for partners.

## Your would be required to:
* Create the new function accepting the "partner" as the first parameter.
* Validate the parameter and return the "ErrInvalidPartner" error if empty
* Retrieve the discount value from the existing repository for the partner, returning the "ErrPartnerNotFound" error if nothing is found
* Calculate the discount using the example provided

## Important to pass the validation checks:
* Do not use parameter type sharing
* Use the naming conventions as per the code and examples
